<p>
    An extended GWT JRE Emulation Library that picks up where GWT's basic set left off.
</p>
<p>
    Effort is made to ensure the JRE emulated library is as API compatible as possible.
    Where there are behavioral incompatibilities, it will be documented. If a method or class
    has no documentation then assume emulated behavior is identical.
