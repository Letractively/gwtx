= Compile Errors =

If you get compile errors with GWTx such as: "The method close() is undefined for the type `OutputStream`" or "Errors in
`'jar:file:/path/to/GWTx.jar!/com/googlecode/gwtx/java/io/emul/java/io/ByteArrayOutputStream.java'"` then odds are you need to put the GWTx.jar before the gwt-user.jar in your project's classpath.
