= Introduction =

The current development release (SVN trunk) of GWTx focus on GWT 1.5 and Java5 compliance.

= Details =

  * Fix all compatibility issues with GWT 1.5
  * Update emulation code based on Apache Harmony code base
  * Investigate new java APIs to emulate

= New APIs =

GWTx 1.5 add support for:

  * javaBeans introspection, including limited support for javax.lang.reflect.Method

Also some "entreprise" APIs are now supported

  * javax.annotation, including javax.annotation.secutiry
  * javax.persistence
  * javax.validation

The two last one are usefull for Spring / JPA users that want to re-use the domain model beans on the client side.

= Deprecations =

The java.util.logging emulation has been removed. Logging has better support from the [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-log gwt-log] project and it's contribution to [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-incubator/wiki/Logging GWT Logging API] in gwt-incubator.

java.io and java.net API emulation has also been removed. They were created to support java.util.logging but never became stable enough for large adoption. If you need them, please contact nicolas.deloof_at_gmail.com to get them back in GWTx.

= Versions =

Starting with this release, GWTx use a versionning scheme to match the target GWT version: the next releases will be versionned 1.5.x.
